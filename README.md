cs_mansion2
===========

This is the popular **cs_mansion** map for CS2.<br/>
As I already made a whole remake for CS:GO, which can be found here [cs_mansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127079570).<br/>
<br/>
Another mansion ramake for CS:GO can be found here [cs_mansion_reloaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269972467)<br/>
<br/>
The new mansion (cs_mansion2) profits from the new Source 2 Engine, which includes PBR-Textures.

It includes:

- PBR-Textures
- Revised Meshes
- Soften Normals (cornes)
- Custom-Sounds
- Smart-Props

---

Todo:

- [ ] Search for a replacement "func_instance_io_proxy" in Source 2
- [ ] Sound implementation (custom sounds, wav -> vsnd) & proper ingame usage
- [ ] Radar (image)
- [ ] Displacements of outside floors
- [ ] More props
- [ ] 3D Skybox
